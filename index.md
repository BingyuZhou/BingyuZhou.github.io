I am a software developer at [Siemens Corporate Technology](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/company/innovation/corporate-technology.html) working in *renewable energy* field. Currently, I focus on the optimization algorithms of battery systems' control and learning algorithms of energy data analysis. I was graduated from [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) with Master of Science degree in Systems and Control, under the supervision of Prof. Javier Alonso-Mora. I was also the recipient of [Justus & Louise van Effen Excellence Scholarships](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/practical-matters/scholarships/justus-louise-van-effen-excellence-scholarships/). I completed my bachelor study in Mechatronic Engineering at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), with a minor in Advanced Honor Class of Engineering Education (ACEE).

My research interest lies in the combination of deep learning and control methods to solve interactive and multi-agent decision making problems.
