I am a software developer at Mercedes Benz AG working on autonomous driving. My focus is developing safe, efficient and socially acceptable behavior planning algorithms to handle the complex and fast involving urban driving situations.

Before I joining Mercedes Benz, I was a software developer at [Siemens Corporate Technology](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/company/innovation/corporate-technology.html) working in *renewable energy* field. My contribution mainly involved optimization algorithms of large-scale battery systems' control and learning algorithms of energy data analysis. Together with the fascinating team at Siemens, we successfully bring this [game-changing clean energy soluton](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/consumer/junelight.html) to the families and industries in Europe. Bravo!

 I was graduated from [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) with Master of Science degree in Systems and Control, under the supervision of Prof. Javier Alonso-Mora. I was also the recipient of [Justus & Louise van Effen Excellence Scholarships](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/practical-matters/scholarships/justus-louise-van-effen-excellence-scholarships/). I completed my bachelor study in Mechatronic Engineering at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), with a minor in Advanced Honor Class of Engineering Education (ACEE).

My research interest lies in the combination of deep learning and control methods to solve interactive and multi-agent decision making problems. Here is my [resume](/assets/CV.pdf "resume").
