I am a software developer at Mercedes Benz AG working on autonomous driving. My focus is developing safe, efficient and socially acceptable behavior planning algorithms to handle the complex and fast involving urban driving situations.

Before joining Mercedes Benz, I was a software developer at [Siemens Corporate Technology](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/company/innovation/corporate-technology.html) working in *renewable energy* field. My contribution mainly involved optimization algorithms of large-scale battery systems' control and learning algorithms of energy data analysis. Together with the fascinating team at Siemens, we successfully bring this [game-changing clean energy soluton](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/consumer/junelight.html) to the families and industries in Europe. Bravo!

My research interest lies in the combination of deep learning and control methods to solve interactive and multi-agent decision making problems.
