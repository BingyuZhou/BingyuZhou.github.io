Generative Adversarial Network ([GAN]()) is a generative framework besides variationall autoencoders which introduces the minmax game theory into unsupervised learning. I have implementated the original GAN propsed by Ian Goodfellow and another improved version for the MNIST digits dataset using the newest *Tensorflow 2.0* library. The encounted problems are documented here. Meanwhile, the possible solutions for notorious GAN training problems are analyzed. It is helpful to get familiar with the practical GAN problems and understand the effect of different network properties. 

## Vanilla GAN

Simple feedforward network with simple loss

### Problems

## Wasserstein Loss

## Improved GAN

Convolution network with wasserstein loss
