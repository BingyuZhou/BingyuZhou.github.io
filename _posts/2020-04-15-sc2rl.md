This post helps you build up your own deep reinforcement learning (DRL) environment for the exciting strategy computer game StarCraftII (SC2). DeepMind's PySC2 project gives us a nice way to interact with the complete game interface. However, how to use this for DRL research or training for your own learning agents is not straightforward. This post summarizes the most important things (tricks) you would like to know before setting up your smart agents. It also presents a training framework in code to speed up you setting up.
