- Container: Isolated process on the machine.
- Image: all dependecies, configuration, scripts, binaries, filesystem needed to run an app.
- Dockerfile: text based script of instructions used to create an image
- Volumes: connect specific filesystem paths of container back to host

## Start a container from an image

```shell
docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started
```
`-d` detached mode (terminal will not get stuck)

### Build image for repo

- Setup Dockerfile.
```
FROM node:12-alpine // based on this image
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN yarn install --production
CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]
```

- Build image

```
docker build -t my-start .
```
`-t`: human readable tag

```
(base) base ❯ docker build -t my-start .

- Run container

```
docker run -dp 3000:3000 my-start
```
port mapping is useful to see the app in host.


### Share imge

You should have an account in docker hub first.

```
docker tag getting-started YOUR-USER-NAME/getting-started
```
`YOUR-USER-NAME`: docker ID.

```
docker push YOUR-USER-NAME/getting-started
```

### Container filesystem

Each container has its own scratch space. Any changes won't be seen in another container, even if they are using the same image.

Operations like create, update and delete will be lost when the container is removed. Volumes are the filesystem to keep it!

- Named volume

Docker automatically create a space in disk. You can access it by the given name. But the mountpoint is hidden.

```
docker volume create todo-db
docker run -dp 3000:3000 -v todo-db:/etc/todos getting-started
```

Tip:
- Where is Docker actually storing the data?

```
docker volume inspect todo-db
[
    {
        "CreatedAt": "2019-09-26T02:18:36Z",
        "Driver": "local",
        "Labels": {},
        "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/todo-db/_data",
        "Name": "todo-db",
        "Options": {},
        "Scope": "local"
    }
]
```

- Bind volume

Control the exact mountpoint on the host.

![](/assets/docker/volume.png)

```
docker run -dp 3000:3000 \
    -w /app -v "$(pwd):/app" \
    node:12-alpine \
    sh -c "yarn install && yarn run dev"
```
`-w`: set working directory

`-v`: mount current directory in host to `/app`

### Docker compose

## Tips

remove all live containers
```
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)
```
