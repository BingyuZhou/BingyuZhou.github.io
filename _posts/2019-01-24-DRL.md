This post is a reflection of my study through OpenAI's tutorial, [Spinningup](git@github.com:BingyuZhou/spinningup.git), of deep reinforcement learning. It mainly covers six popular algorithms including **Vanilla Policy Gradient (VPG)**, **Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)**, **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**, **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)**, **Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)** and **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**. I have implemented all these algorithms under the guidance of the tutorial. I would like to highlight the key ideas and critical theory behind each algorithm in this post. Meanwhile, I will also share the benchmark performance of these algorithms using my own implementation.
