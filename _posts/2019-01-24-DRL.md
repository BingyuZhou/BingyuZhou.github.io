This post is a reflection of my study through OpenAI's tutorial, [Spinningup](git@github.com:BingyuZhou/spinningup.git), of deep reinforcement learning. It mainly covers six popular algorithms including **Vanilla Policy Gradient (VPG)**, **Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)**, **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**, **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)**, **Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)** and **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**. I have implemented all these algorithms under the guidance of the tutorial. I would like to highlight the key ideas and critical theory behind each algorithm in this post. Meanwhile, I will also share the benchmark performance of these algorithms using my own implementation.

The figure below shows the category of all the presentated algorithms. They all belongs to model free RL algorithms, since they do not explicitly learn a model or have access to the environment model.

Policy Optimization:

- directly optimizes the performance of the policy, either explicitly using policy gradient, or modifying policy gradient for the sake of stability and efficientcy.
- normally belongs to actor-acritic structure
- usually runs in on-policy
- stable and reliable training as *directly optimize what we want*


Q Learning:

- also called value learning methods;
- implicitly finds optimal policy through learning action value or value function to match Bellman equation. Optimal actions are computed through optimal Q function:
$$ a^* = \arg\max Q^*(s,a) $$

- almost always runs in off-policy
- less stable training in practice
- higher sample efficiency when it works

The mixed algorithms (TD3, SAC, DDPG) lie between these two approches.

## Vanilla Policy Gradient

This algorithm is the most basic policy gradient version, which is also called REINFORCE.

## Trust Region Policy Optimization

## Proximal Policy Optimization

## Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient

## Twin Delayed DDPG

## Soft Actor-Critic
